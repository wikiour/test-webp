# Test WebP - Checking WebP support

WebP is an image format developed by Google that is a compressed image format that provides higher compression than JPEG and PNG. However, not all browsers support WebP, so it's important for web developers to check that their sites support this format.

This module checks the support for WebP images and assigns a class for the body. If the browser does not support it assigns the class webp if it does not support it assigns the class no-webp

###### Connecting via npm
```
npm i -D test-webp
```

###### Connecting to the project
```
import testWebp from 'test-webp';
testWebp();
```

Verifying WebP support is important for optimizing page load speed and improving the user experience.
